#+TITLE: Glip

* Intuduction
Glip is *G*o *L*ocal *I*n *P*roject. It keeps your Go packages local
to the project you're working on, so that you can have two or more Go
project depend on different version of the same package.

The =glip= command simply proxies to the =go= command. You must use it
in place of =go=.

* How to use Glip
Simply import the package you want in the file you want to use it.

#+BEGIN_SRC go
import (
        "fmt"
        fb "github.com/google/flatbuffers/go"
)

func main() {
	builder := fb.NewBuilder(0)
	fmt.Println("%v", builder)
}
#+END_SRC

Then tell =glip= to fetch any packages you're using.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./glip get
#+END_SRC

Then build with =glip=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./glip build -o runme
#+END_SRC

*IMPORTANT* If you're testing =glip= inside this directory named
 =glip= us must specify the =-o <executable>= option otherwise you
 will overwrite =glip=. If the directory has any other name you don't
 need the =-o <executable>= option.
